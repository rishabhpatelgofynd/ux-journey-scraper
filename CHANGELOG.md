## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added - Native & Wrapper App Testing

**Major Feature**: Native Android and iOS app testing via Appium. All four mobile
app architecture types are now supported: WebView wrappers (Ionic/Capacitor/Cordova),
React Native, Flutter, and pure native (Swift/Kotlin).

#### New Platform Types
- **`native_android`**: Android app testing via UiAutomator2
- **`native_ios`**: iOS app testing via XCUITest (macOS only)

#### New Core Modules
- **`core/appium_session.py`**: Builds Appium capabilities for Android (UiAutomator2)
  and iOS (XCUITest); validates server reachability before crawl starts
- **`core/native_element_detector.py`**: Traverses Appium accessibility tree and
  scores elements using the same `PRIORITY_KEYWORDS` table as `NavigationQueue`
- **`core/gesture_engine.py`**: Touch primitives — tap, scroll, swipe-back (iOS edge
  gesture + Android BACK key), pull-to-refresh, long press, keyboard dismiss
- **`core/mobile_state_registry.py`**: Perceptual-hash (pHash) based screen
  deduplication; falls back to MD5 when `imagehash` is not installed
- **`core/appium_crawler.py`**: Main crawler — same public interface as
  `AutonomousCrawler` (`crawl() → Journey`, `get_stats() → Dict`);
  handles WebView, native, and Flutter (semantics-disabled) modes

#### Config Changes (`config/scrape_config.py`)
- New `NativeAppConfig` dataclass (Appium server, app package/bundle ID, device name,
  platform version, AVD name, APK/IPA path, simulator UDID)
- `PlatformConfig.viewport` is now `Optional` — not required for native platforms
- `PlatformConfig.native: Optional[NativeAppConfig]` — required for native platforms
- `PlatformConfig.is_native` and `PlatformConfig.is_web` boolean properties
- `ScrapeConfig.load()` parses the `native:` YAML block into `NativeAppConfig`

#### CLI Changes (`cli/main.py`)
- Native platforms route to `AppiumCrawler`; web platforms to `AutonomousCrawler`
- Graceful skip with install instructions when Appium package is not installed
- Version bumped to `0.5.0`

#### Platform Discovery (`core/platform_discovery.py`)
- `_discover_ios_bundle_id()`: Live iTunes Search API (public, no key); table fallback
- `_discover_android_package()`: Live `google-play-scraper` search; table fallback

#### Architecture Routing
- WebView (Ionic/Capacitor): switches to WEBVIEW context → DOM automation
- React Native / Swift / Kotlin: native accessibility tree traversal
- Flutter (semantics disabled): screenshot-only scroll mode with log warning
- OS permission dialogs auto-dismissed (camera, location, notifications)

### Added - Dependencies (optional group `[native]`)
- `Appium-Python-Client>=3.1.0`
- `google-play-scraper>=1.2.0`
- `imagehash>=4.3.0`

Install with: `pip install 'ux-journey-scraper[native]'`

### Output Structure
```
journey_output/
  web_desktop/journey.json + screenshots/    ← Phase 1
  web_mobile/journey.json  + screenshots/    ← Phase 1
  native_android/journey.json + screenshots/ ← Phase 2 (new)
  native_ios/journey.json  + screenshots/    ← Phase 2 (new, macOS only)
```

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added - Multi-Platform Web Crawling

**Major Feature**: `ux-journey crawl` now loops over all configured platforms in a single run, producing per-platform output directories.

#### Multi-Platform Crawling
- **All platforms in one run**: Configure `web_desktop`, `web_mobile`, and `web_tablet` in YAML; the crawler runs each sequentially and saves results to separate subdirs (`journey_output/web_desktop/`, `journey_output/web_mobile/`, `journey_output/web_tablet/`)
- **Tablet support**: `web_tablet` (iPad Air 820×1180) is now a first-class platform alongside desktop and mobile
- **Per-platform output**: Each platform gets its own `journey.json` and `screenshots/` folder

#### Bug Fixes
- **Tablet UA string**: Fixed truncated iPad user-agent (was missing `(KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.4.1 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1` suffix)
- **Tablet `device_scale_factor`**: Fixed — tablet now correctly gets `device_scale_factor=2.0` (same as mobile); was incorrectly using `1.0`

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped to 0.4.0
- **CLI**: `crawl` command header now shows `v0.4.0`; output summary shows per-platform page counts

### Added - Dependencies
- `aiohttp>=3.9.0`: Required by `platform_discovery.py` (was imported but missing from `pyproject.toml`)

### Roadmap - Phase 2 (v0.5.0)
Native iOS/Android app testing via Appium is documented as the next milestone. Stubs (`platform_discovery.py`, `app_architecture_detector.py`) are preserved for Phase 2 integration.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added - Autonomous Crawling

**Major Feature**: Full autonomous crawling capabilities - the scraper now intelligently navigates websites without manual intervention.

#### New Core Components
- **YAML Configuration System** (`config/scrape_config.py`): Config-first approach replacing individual CLI flags
- **Autonomous Crawler** (`core/autonomous_crawler.py`): Priority queue-based intelligent navigation engine
- **Navigation Queue** (`core/navigation_queue.py`): Priority heap for smart action ordering ("Add to Cart" before "Learn More")
- **Element Intelligence** (`core/element_intelligence.py`): 4-strategy clickable detection (semantic, ARIA, onclick, cursor:pointer)
- **Page Readiness Engine** (`core/page_readiness.py`): Advanced readiness detection (DOM stability, spinners, lazy-load)
- **State Registry** (`core/state_registry.py`): 3-layer deduplication (URL, DOM hash, structural hash)
- **Human Behavior Simulator** (`core/human_behaviour.py`): Bezier mouse movements, realistic typing, human delays
- **Stealth Browser** (`core/stealth_browser.py`): Anti-bot detection with full fingerprint spoofing
- **Auth Manager** (`core/auth_manager.py`): Session injection + login flow automation
- **Form Filler** (`core/form_filler.py`): Smart autocomplete-based form filling with payment safeguards

#### New CLI Commands
- `ux-journey crawl --config <file>`: Primary command for autonomous crawling (v0.2.0)
- Config file support: All settings now via YAML instead of CLI flags

#### Enhanced Capabilities
- **SPA Support**: Full support for single-page applications with dynamic content
- **Lazy Loading**: Scroll-triggered content detection and loading
- **Checkout Flows**: Automatic form filling for e-commerce checkout (test data only)
- **Logged-in Crawling**: Session management and auth wall recovery
- **Anti-Bot Bypass**: Stealth browser with 16-point fingerprint spoofing
- **Priority Navigation**: High-value actions (purchase flows) prioritized over low-value (footer links)

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped to 0.2.0
- **CLI**: Old commands (`record`, `run`) now deprecated with warnings
- **Output**: Enhanced journey format (same structure, enhanced metadata coming in v0.3.0)

### Added - Dependencies
- `pyyaml>=6.0.0`: YAML configuration parsing
- `aiofiles>=23.0.0`: Async file I/O operations

### Added - Safety Features
- **Payment Submit Safeguard**: Global kill switch prevents real payment submissions
- **Test Cards Only**: Validates only test payment cards are used (4111111111111111, etc.)
- **CAPTCHA Detection**: Detects and flags CAPTCHA challenges

### Added - Documentation
- `MIGRATION.md`: Comprehensive v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 migration guide
- `scrape-config.example.yaml`: Full configuration template with comments
- Enhanced README with autonomous crawling examples

### Improved
- **Page Readiness**:
  - From: Basic `networkidle` check
  - To: DOM stability + spinner dismissal + image loading + lazy-load scroll
  - **Impact**: Fixes "screenshot too early" problem (most critical UX capture issue)

- **Element Detection**:
  - From: Hardcoded `button`, `a` selectors
  - To: 4-strategy detection (semantic, ARIA, event listeners, CSS cursor)
  - **Impact**: Finds 3-5x more interactive elements

- **State Deduplication**:
  - From: URL comparison only
  - To: 3-layer (URL normalization, DOM hash, structural hash)
  - **Impact**: Prevents infinite loops on SPAs

### Breaking Changes
- **Config Required**: `ux-journey crawl` requires `--config` flag
- **Version Change**: CLI version now shows 0.2.0
- **Deprecated Commands**: `record` and `run` still work but show deprecation warnings

### Expected Coverage Improvement
- **v0.1.0 Baseline**: 30% of websites work well (static sites only)
- **v0.2.0 Target**: 80-90% of websites (SPAs, e-commerce, auth-required sites)

### Known Limitations (v0.2.0)
